Phase 3: Managerial Defense

Governance, Financial Reasoning & Executive Decision
Product: Project Continuity AI Agent
Organization: Halyk Bank JSC
Scope: Internal Resource Verification, Audit Readiness, Delivery Proof
 
1. Financial Reasoning (ROI Justification)
Baseline Assumptions (Kazakhstan Context)
Parameter	Value	Notes
Avg IT / Delivery Manager salary	900,000 KZT / month	Conservative bank estimate
Working hours	160 hours / month	
Hourly cost	5,600 KZT	
Manual reconciliation effort	6–10 hours / project	From discovery
Avg used value	8 hours	Conservative
 
Per-Project Cost (Current State)
8 hours × 5,600 KZT = 44,800 KZT / project
 
Annual Impact (Moderate Scale)
Assume:
•	150 active projects / year across IT & Agile Tribes
44,800 × 150 = 6.7M KZT / year (direct labor cost)
 
With Project Continuity AI (Target State)
•	70% reduction in manual reconciliation time
•	Time saved per project ≈ 5.6 hours
5.6 × 5,600 = 31,360 KZT / project
31,360 × 150 = ~4.7M KZT / year
 
Hard ROI (Conservative)
Category	Annual Value
Direct labor savings	4.7M KZT
Reduced audit prep effort	2–3M KZT (est.)
Avoided audit rework & delays	Non-linear, high impact
Minimum defendable ROI: 7–8M KZT / year
Real value: Risk avoidance + trust restoration (not linearly priced)
 
2. Strategic Value (Beyond Cost Savings)
This project does not primarily optimize cost.
It optimizes organizational trust.
What Changes for Leadership
Before	After
Trust = signed paper	Trust = explainable digital evidence
Lagging reports	Continuous confidence metrics
Audit panic	Audit readiness by default
Human memory	Institutional memory
This directly addresses the Board’s trust bias, discovered in Phase 2.
 
3. AI Governance & Kazakhstan Compliance Check
3.1 Data Residency & Sovereignty 
•	Jira, ERP, certificates processed inside KZ
•	No external LLM APIs
•	Deployment options:
o	On-prem
o	KZ-certified private cloud
Status: Compliant with data localization expectations
 
3.2 Explainability & Audit Transparency 
•	All AI outputs:
o	Numeric
o	Justified
o	Reproducible
•	Every certificate links to:
o	Source tasks
o	Timestamps
o	Approval evidence
No black-box decisions
 
3.3 Human Accountability 
•	AI does not approve
•	AI recommends
•	Final authority:
o	Project Manager
o	Auditor
o	Executive sponsor
This aligns with:
•	NBK expectations
•	Internal audit standards
 
3.4 Ethical Risk Assessment
Risk	Mitigation
Over-trusting AI scores	Mandatory human sign-off
Metric gaming	Cross-system validation
Bias in scoring	Rule-based v1, ML later
 
4. Go / No-Go Decision
Executive Recommendation: GO — Controlled Pilot
 
Why This Is a GO
•	Clear JTBD tied to trust, not hype

•	Quantifiable ROI with conservative assumptions
 
•	Low regulatory and ethical risk

•	Solves a real board-level pain
 
•	Builds product capability, not IT automation
 
Conditions for Approval (Critical)
1.	Single Product Owner
o	Accountable for audit outcomes, not delivery tasks
2.	Pilot Scope
o	2–3 Agile Tribes
o	Internal audits only (no external regulators in v1)
3.	Outcome KPIs
o	Manual reconciliation hours
o	Audit findings count
o	Leadership confidence (qualitative)
 
Final Executive Framing (Use This Line)
“This AI does not replace trust.
It makes trust measurable.”
 
5. Final Verdict
Decision: GO (Pilot → Scale)
Strategic Impact: High
Regulatory Risk: Low
Financial Risk: Low
Organizational Value: Very High
