# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Product: Project Continuity AI Agent

### Problem Statement
Halyk Bank suffers from a trust gap where leadership values signed paper outputs
over digital outcome-based reporting.

### Job To Be Done (JTBD)
When coordinating resources across Agile Tribes and IT,
I want automated, auditable proof of work completion,
so that I can report confidently without manual reconciliation.

### Functional Requirements
- Jira ↔ ERP synchronization
- Auto-generation of digital Work Completion Certificates
- Compliance-ready audit trail
- Explainable decision logs

### Success Metrics
- 70% reduction in manual reconciliation time
- Audit preparation time reduced by 50%

1. Problem Statement

Halyk Bank experiences significant operational friction due to a trust gap between leadership, Agile Tribes, and IT functional units.

While teams operate digitally (Jira, ERP, internal tools), senior management and audit bodies continue to rely on manually signed paper-based outputs as proof of work completion.

Current Issues

Manual reconciliation between Jira and ERP systems

High audit preparation effort due to missing or inconsistent documentation

Low confidence in digital reporting

Delays caused by human verification and approval bottlenecks

Quantified Impact (Current State – Estimated)

6–10 hours per project spent on manual reconciliation

~30% of tasks require follow-up clarification before audits

Increased audit risk due to inconsistent evidence trails

2. Job To Be Done (JTBD)

When coordinating resources and deliverables across Agile Tribes and IT departments,
I want automated, auditable, and explainable proof of work completion,
So that I can confidently report progress, reduce manual effort, and pass audits without relying on paper-based verification.

3. Product Vision

Project Continuity is an AI-powered agent that:

Continuously analyzes project execution data

Synchronizes operational systems (Jira, ERP)

Generates quantitative confidence and risk metrics

Produces audit-ready digital proof of completion

The agent acts as a trust layer between execution teams and leadership.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Data Integration

Bi-directional synchronization between:

Jira (tasks, statuses, timestamps)

ERP (resource allocation, approvals, budgets)

Continuous monitoring of task and approval consistency

4.2 AI Insight & Scoring Engine

The AI agent analyzes project data and generates numerical, explainable outputs.

AI-Generated Metrics
Metric	Description
Completion Confidence Score (%)	Probability that tasks are genuinely completed
Audit Readiness Score (%)	Likelihood of passing an internal/external audit
Estimated Manual Time Saved (hours)	Reduction in reconciliation effort
Anomaly Detection Rate (%)	Percentage of tasks flagged as inconsistent
Risk Level	Low / Medium / High (with numeric justification)
Example AI Output
{
  "tasks_analyzed": 187,
  "completion_confidence": 92,
  "audit_readiness_score": 88,
  "estimated_time_saved_hours": 6.4,
  "anomaly_rate": 7.5,
  "risk_level": "Low"
}

4.3 Digital Work Completion Certificates

Auto-generation of digital Work Completion Certificates

Each certificate includes:

AI confidence score

Supporting evidence (tasks, approvals, timestamps)

Explainable reasoning for approval

4.4 Explainability & Audit Trail

Human-readable explanations for every AI decision

Immutable logs showing:

What data was used

Why a task was approved or flagged

What risks were detected

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Explainability-first AI (no black-box decisions)

Compliance with internal audit standards

Scalable to multiple projects and departments

Designed for future backend and ML integration

6. Success Metrics (Target State)
Metric	Target
Manual reconciliation time	↓ 70%
Audit preparation time	↓ 50%
Task verification confidence	≥ 90%
Audit issue rate	↓ 40%
Leadership reporting satisfaction	Qualitatively improved
7. Assumptions & Constraints

Metrics are AI-derived estimates, based on defined assumptions and historical baselines

Initial version operates as a decision-support system

No replacement of human auditors — AI augments trust and efficiency

8. Why This Is an AI Product

Project Continuity qualifies as an AI system because it:

Synthesizes multi-source data

Applies weighted reasoning to incomplete information

Produces probabilistic outputs (confidence, risk)

Provides explainable, auditable decisions

9. Future Enhancements

Machine learning model trained on historical audit outcomes

Predictive risk alerts before audit deadlines

Cross-project benchmarking and optimization`
