Thank you for those insights. It's clear that your value proposition lies in **bridging the "AI Literacy Gap"** for educators. Your product isn't just about the technology; it’s about a "done-for-you" or "highly simplified" service that removes the technical and psychological barriers of being on camera.

 **EduFlow**

# Product Requirements Document (PRD): EduFlow

## 1. Executive Summary
EduFlow is an AI-powered content creation platform designed specifically for teachers who want to launch online courses but lack the time, technical skills, or desire to be on camera. By leveraging AI avatars and text-to-speech technology, EduFlow allows educators to convert text-based lesson plans into professional-grade video modules without requiring a studio, microphone, or camera.

## 2. Problem Statement
*   **High Friction:** Traditional video production (lighting, recording, editing) is time-consuming and expensive.
*   **Tech Anxiety:** Many teachers, particularly in specific regional markets, are intimidated by complex AI tools like HeyGen or Synthesia.
*   **The "Camera Shy" Barrier:** Many subject matter experts are reluctant to teach online because they are uncomfortable being filmed.
*   **Opportunity Cost:** Teachers have the knowledge but lack the means to monetize it in the digital economy.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** K-12 and University teachers looking for side income.
*   **Secondary:** Corporate trainers and subject matter experts in non-tech regions.
*   **Persona:** "The Analog Expert"—High pedagogical knowledge, low technical confidence, limited free time.

## 4. Key Features (MVP)

### 4.1. The "No-Face" Course Builder
*   **AI Avatar Selection:** A library of professional, relatable educator avatars.
*   **Local Language TTS:** High-quality text-to-speech engine supporting local accents and dialects to ensure students feel a connection.
*   **Script-to-Video Pipeline:** Users upload a Word/PDF lesson plan, and the AI generates a structured script and video.

### 4.2. Visual Integration
*   **Slide Synchronization:** Ability to upload PowerPoint/Google Slides that appear alongside the AI avatar.
*   **Automatic B-Roll:** AI suggests and inserts relevant images/icons based on the lesson text.

### 4.3. Simplified Interface (The "Guided" Experience)
*   **Step-by-Step Wizard:** A non-technical workflow: 1. Upload Content -> 2. Pick Voice/Avatar -> 3. Review -> 4. Export.
*   **Localization:** The entire dashboard is in the local language of the teacher.

### 4.4. Monetization Bridge
*   **Direct Export:** One-click export to platforms like Udemy, Teachable, or a local LMS.
*   **Branding Kit:** Basic tools to add the teacher’s name and logo to the video.

## 5. User Flow
1.  **Onboarding:** Teacher signs up and selects their teaching subject.
2.  **Input:** Teacher uploads a text document or types their lecture notes.
3.  **Customization:** Teacher chooses an avatar that matches their demographic and a voice that sounds natural.
4.  **Drafting:** The system generates a preview of the first 30 seconds.
5.  **Processing:** Once approved, the full high-definition video is rendered.
6.  **Delivery:** Teacher receives a link to download the video or host it on the EduFlow landing page.

## 6. Technical Requirements & Constraints
*   **API Integration:** Use HeyGen, Synthesia, or D-ID APIs for video generation; OpenAI (GPT-4) for script optimization.
*   **Latency:** Video rendering may take time; implement an email notification system for when the video is ready.
*   **Storage:** Secure cloud hosting for high-resolution video assets.

## 7. Success Metrics
*   **Time-to-Course:** Reduce the average time to create a 10-minute lesson from 5 hours (traditional) to 15 minutes.
*   **Teacher Adoption:** Number of teachers in the target region who complete their first module.
*   **Retention:** Percentage of users who create a second course after the first one is published.

## 8. Roadmap
*   **Phase 1:** MVP with 5 avatars and localized TTS.
*   **Phase 2:** "Slide-to-Video" automation (auto-syncing PPT slides with the avatar’s speech).
*   **Phase 3:** Internal marketplace where teachers can sell courses directly within the EduFlow ecosystem.
