PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Product: Project Continuity AI Agent
Version: 1.1 | Organization: Halyk Bank | Status: Draft

=== PROBLEM STATEMENT ===
Halyk Bank's Resource Coordinators spend 10+ hours per week manually reconciling
project status data between Jira and Excel-based ERP reports. The root cause is a
trust gap: leadership only accepts manually signed, paper-based Work Completion
Certificates (WCCs) as proof of delivery.

=== JOB TO BE DONE (JTBD) ===
WHEN coordinating resources across Agile Tribes and IT at the end of a sprint,
I WANT an automated system that generates auditable, digitally-signed WCCs from Jira and ERP data,
SO THAT I can satisfy audit requirements without manual reconciliation.

=== FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ===

FR-01: Jira to ERP Synchronization
- The system must automatically pull completed task data from Jira and map it to ERP project codes.
- Acceptance Criteria: Data sync runs automatically at sprint close. Zero manual steps required.

FR-02: Auto-generation of Work Completion Certificates (WCC) in PDF format
- Acceptance Criteria: WCC generated within 5 minutes of sprint closure. Matches paper template.

FR-03: Digital Signature and Audit Trail
- Every WCC must be digitally signed with a tamper-proof audit log.
- Acceptance Criteria: Every WCC has a verifiable digital signature. Logs cannot be modified.

FR-04: Explainable Decision Logs
- The system must log every data transformation in plain language.
- Acceptance Criteria: Each log entry states source field, transformation applied, and output value.

FR-05: Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Only authorized roles (Coordinator, Auditor, Board Viewer) may access WCCs.
- Acceptance Criteria: Unauthorized access attempts are blocked and logged.

FR-06: Error Handling for Missing or Inconsistent Data
- CRITICAL: The system must raise a clear alert if Jira or ERP data is missing or inconsistent.
- The system must NOT auto-generate a WCC with incomplete data.
- Acceptance Criteria: If source data is missing, system halts and sends an alert. No silent failures.

=== NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ===

NFR-01: Data Residency - All data must be processed within Kazakhstan (KZ Data Law 2013).
NFR-02: Performance - WCC generation must complete in under 5 minutes for up to 200 tasks.
NFR-03: Availability - 99.5% uptime during business hours (09:00-18:00 AST).
NFR-04: Security - TLS 1.2+ in transit. AES-256 encryption at rest.
NFR-05: Explainability - Every AI output must be traceable to a source field. No black-box decisions.

=== SUCCESS METRICS ===
- 70% reduction in manual reconciliation time (from 10 hours to 3 hours/week)
- 50% reduction in audit preparation time (from 40 hours to 20 hours/quarter)
- WCC generation errors below 2%
